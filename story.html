      <h1> What are the chances? </h1>
      <p> Every persons life is like a rope. They begin as individual strands that eventually get woven together with others through the experiences we gain over time. We may think these connections are strong, but there is no telling who will break off at any time. This fact will often make people sad or confused, <em> why did this happen? who else will leave? will I be okay? </em> </p><blockquote> Yes you will be fine. </blockquote>
      <p> Each person that comes into our lives has a set purpose for being there. Now, it might not be for our sake. It may be for their own purpose or it could even benefit somebody else. The thing is, we will probably never truly know. There are moments when a fleeting interaction or a seemingly random encounter leaves an indelible mark, guiding us with an almost mystical precision. It often feels as if people come into our lives at certain times for reasons beyond our understanding, each one playing a crucial role in shaping our destiny. </p>

      <p> Working in a coffee shop, I meet new people every day who share their stories with me, and in turn, I share parts of my own life. Each conversation is a unique thread woven into my daily experience, contributing to the larger tapestry of my existence. Some individuals enter the shop during pivotal moments in their lives and, through our brief interactions, offer me guidance, support, or wisdom that feels like a lifeline. They might only visit once, yet their impact reverberates through my thoughts, shifting my perspectives or igniting the courage within me to chase my dreams. These encounters often seem predestined, as though some unseen force has brought us together at precisely the right time.</p>

      <p> One person in particular comes to mind when I think about one time encounters. His name is Tom. <s>Simple.</s> He has lived many lives and loves to tell me little details about his days that may seem insignificant to some, but are interesting to me. For example, last week Tom was explaining how he always had a fear of failing when he landed his first ever role at <abbr title="American Express">AMEX</abbr>abbr> and how his constant stressing and worrying lead to him missing an important meeting where he was scheduled to present. This then lead to him eventually getting laid off. What do think happened next? </p><blockquote> NOTHING! </blockquote>
      <p> Since he had so much new time on his hands, he decided to explore his interests and found himself traveling South America. Tom was hitchhiking and staying with stranger (do not try this, this occurred in the 70's), and eventually met a guy who offered Tom a job in cinema. For the next 35 years, Tom found his passion and enjoyed going to work everyday. I don't think Tom knew it but I was going through something similar. I was working a job I hated and I was so afriad to quit because I thought I would never find another job (I put 4 years of work into my bachelor's for this job). Listening to Tom speak about his experience stuck with me and helped me make the decision to leave my job. </p><blockquote> And I have never been happier. </blockquote>
