    <title> A One Time Encounter </title>
  </head>
    <body> 
      <h1> What are the chances? </h1>
      <p> Every persons life is like a rope. They begin as individual strands that eventually get woven together with others through the experiences we gain over time. We may think these connections are strong, but there is no telling who will break off at any time. This fact will often make people sad or confused, <em> why did this happen? who else will leave? will I be okay? </em> </p><blockquote> Yes you will be fine. </blockquote>
      <p> Each person that comes into our lives has a set purpose for being there. Now, it might not be for our sake. It may be for their own purpose or it could even benefit somebody else. The thing is, we will probably never truly know. There are moments when a fleeting interaction or a seemingly random encounter leaves an indelible mark, guiding us with an almost mystical precision. It often feels as if people come into our lives at certain times for reasons beyond our understanding, each one playing a crucial role in shaping our destiny. </p>

      <p> Working in a coffee shop, I meet new people every day who share their stories with me, and in turn, I share parts of my own life. Each conversation is a unique thread woven into my daily experience, contributing to the larger tapestry of my existence. Some individuals enter the shop during pivotal moments in their lives and, through our brief interactions, offer me guidance, support, or wisdom that feels like a lifeline. They might only visit once, yet their impact reverberates through my thoughts, shifting my perspectives or igniting the courage within me to chase my dreams. These encounters often seem predestined, as though some unseen force has brought us together at precisely the right time.</p>

      <p> One person in particular comes to mind when I think about one time encounters. His name is Tom. <s>Simple.</s> He has lived many lives and loves to tell me little details about his days that may seem insignificant to some, but are interesting to me. For example, last week Tom was explaining how he always had a fear of failing when he landed his first ever role at <abbr title="American Express">AMEX</abbr> and how his constant stressing and worrying lead to him missing an important meeting where he was scheduled to present. This then lead to him eventually getting laid off. What do think happened next? </p><blockquote> NOTHING! </blockquote>
      <p> Since he had so much new time on his hands, he decided to explore his interests and found himself traveling South America. Tom was hitchhiking and staying with strangers (do not try this, this occurred in the 70's), and eventually met a guy who offered Tom a job in cinema. For the next 35 years, Tom found his passion and enjoyed going to work everyday. I don't think Tom knew it but I was going through something similar. I was working a job I hated and I was so afraid to quit because I thought I would never find another job (I put 4 years of work into my bachelor's for this job) and began making myself sick with stress. Listening to Tom speak about his experience stuck with me and helped me make the decision to leave my job. </p><blockquote> And I have never been happier. </blockquote>
      <p> I never knew Tom would have such a huge impact on me. A simple story lead to me making a decision that would change the trajectory of my life. I am now in graduate school working on a new degree while I travel the world and gain experiences I will look back on and smile. </p>

      <h2> Trust in time </h2>
      <p> I don't see Tom much these days. These people, who come into our lives for short periods, often leave a lasting mark. Their presence, though temporary, can provide clarity and direction during times of confusion. They offer a fresh perspective or a piece of advice that becomes a turning point in our journey. These brief yet meaningful encounters remind us that sometimes, the right person appears at just the right moment, bringing exactly what we need to move forward. </p>
      <p> Think back on those people who were in your life for short periods of time, they were probably there when you needed someone to talk to or to have around. <em> What wisdom did they leave for you? How did your interactions change the way you look at the world? Did you learn something from them? </em> Reflecting on the people we encounter can help us understand ourselves and leave lasting impressions. Even people who left a negative mark on us. Some people enter our world and treat us poorly, leaving us hurt and questioning ourselves. However, these challenging relationships can also be valuable teachers, showing us that we deserve more and helping us understand our own worth. </p>
      <p> In my personal life, I've faced difficult relationships that were painful and damaging. I once had this friend who constantly belittled my achievements and made me feel small. At first, I tolerated their behavior, believing that I had to accept their treatment to maintain the friendship. Over time, however, I began to see the negative impact this person had on my self-esteem and happiness. This realization was a turning point for me, pushing me to reevaluate what I deserved in my relationships. </p>
      <p> Each difficult relationship, though painful, has been a stepping stone toward a deeper understanding of my own value and the kind of treatment I deserve. Whether it was a boss who undervalued my contributions, a partner who took me for granted, or a so-called friend who betrayed my trust, these experiences, though hurtful, have forced me to confront my own beliefs about what I deserve. They have compelled me to set higher standards for how I allow others to treat me. </p>

      <p> Remember that every person has some sort of impact on our lives, whether that is good or bad, and we probably won't know which until they are gone. So take a moment in your day to stop and talk to your local barista, hold the door for the person behind you, compliment the girl with cool shoes, or ask someone on the street for a restaurant reccomendation. You never know what pieces of knowledge you will gain from these conversations or how they might impact your own future. </p>
