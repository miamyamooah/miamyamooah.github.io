      <h1> What are the chances? </h1>
      <p> Every persons life is like a rope. They begin as individual strands that eventually get woven together with others through the experiences we gain over time. We may think these connections are strong, but there is no telling who will break off at any time. This fact will often make people sad or confused, <em> why did this happen? who else will leave? will I be okay? </em> </p><blockquote> Yes you will be fine. </blockquote>
      <p> Each person that comes into our lives has a set purpose for being there. Now, it might not be for our sake. It may be for their own purpose or it could even benefit somebody else. The thing is, we will probably never truly know. There are moments when a fleeting interaction or a seemingly random encounter leaves an indelible mark, guiding us with an almost mystical precision. It often feels as if people come into our lives at certain times for reasons beyond our understanding, each one playing a crucial role in shaping our destiny. </p>
      <p> Working in a coffee shop, I meet new people every day who share their stories with me, and in turn, I share parts of my own life. Each conversation is a unique thread woven into my daily experience, contributing to the larger tapestry of my existence. Some individuals enter the shop during pivotal moments in their lives and, through our brief interactions, offer me guidance, support, or wisdom that feels like a lifeline. They might only visit once, yet their impact reverberates through my thoughts, shifting my perspectives or igniting the courage within me to chase my dreams. These encounters often seem predestined, as though some unseen force has brought us together at precisely the right time.</p>
