    <h1> Hi, my name is Mariah :) </h1>
    <p> I am in my second semester here at Quinnipiac University working on my masters in instructional design. Every time I tell someone what my major is, they always ask "What is that?" or "I have never heard of that before, what do you do?" It always leads to a fun conversation, usually ending in the person telling me I should just be a teacher. I was a teacher for two years and decided to begin my transition out of the classroom and into something I would enjoy more. </p>

    <h2> Something I have learned: </h2>
    <p> I am fairly new to the world of instructional design. There is a lot of information to take in, so I am still learning how to navigate it all. This course has been the hardest for me so far. I do not have any prior experience with coding or HTML, so I felt really intimidated at first. I believe I am beginning to understand it but I expect to run into more bumps. </p>
