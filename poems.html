                You do not do, you do not do<br>
                Any more, black shoe<br>
                In which I have lived like a foot<br>
                For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
                Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.<br><br>

                Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
                You died before I had time——<br>
                Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
                Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
                Big as a Frisco seal<br><br>

                And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>
                Where it pours bean green over blue<br>
                In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>
                I used to pray to recover you.<br>
                Ach, du.<br><br>

                In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
                Scraped flat by the roller<br>
                Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
                But the name of the town is common.<br>
                My Polack friend<br><br>

                Says there are a dozen or two.<br>
                So I never could tell where you<br>
                Put your foot, your root,<br>
                I never could talk to you.<br>
                The tongue stuck in my jaw.<br><br>

                It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>
                Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
                I could hardly speak.<br>
                I thought every German was you.<br>
                And the language obscene<br><br>

                An engine, an engine<br>
                Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
                A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>
                I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
                I think I may well be a Jew.<br><br>

                The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>
                Are not very pure or true.<br>
                With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>
                And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
                I may be a bit of a Jew.<br><br>

                I have always been scared of you,<br>
                With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
                And your neat mustache<br>
                And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
                Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——<br><br>

                Not God but a swastika<br>
                So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
                Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
                The boot in the face, the brute<br>
                Brute heart of a brute like you.<br><br>

                You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
                In the picture I have of you,<br>
                A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
                But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
                Any less the black man who<br><br>

                Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
                I was ten when they buried you.<br>
                At twenty I tried to die<br>
                And get back, back, back to you.<br>
                I thought even the bones would do.<br><br>

                But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
                And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
                And then I knew what to do.<br>
                I made a model of you,<br>
                A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br><br>

                And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
                And I said I do, I do.<br>
                So daddy, I’m finally through.<br>
                The black telephone’s off at the root,<br>
                The voices just can’t worm through.<br><br>

                If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——<br>
                The vampire who said he was you<br>
                And drank my blood for a year,<br>
                Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
                Daddy, you can lie back now.<br><br>

                There’s a stake in your fat black heart<br>
                And the villagers never liked you.<br>
                They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
                They always knew it was you.<br>
                Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.<br>

               "Sylvia Plath's 'Daddy' is a powerful poem exploring themes of identity, trauma, and liberation. Written in 1962, it reflects Plath's complex relationship with her deceased father, Otto Plath. The poem's tone is accusatory and confessional, using vivid and sometimes violent imagery to portray her father's influence on her life and psyche. Structured as a dramatic monologue, the speaker addresses her father directly, expressing long-held resentments and emotional scars. Plath employs metaphors and allusions, comparing her father to a Nazi and herself to a Holocaust victim, underscoring the intensity of her emotions. The poem's rhythm and repetition create a haunting effect, drawing readers into the speaker's turbulent inner world. As the poem progresses, the speaker moves towards liberation, ultimately declaring freedom from her father's shadow. 'Daddy' is one of Plath's most famous and controversial works, known for its raw depiction of personal anguish and emotional depth."

                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>

                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br><br>

                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>

                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>

                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>

                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br><br>

                And I a smiling woman.<br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>

                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>

                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br><br>

                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentlemen, ladies<br><br>

                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br><br>

                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>

                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br>
                I rocked shut<br><br>

                As a seashell.<br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>

                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>

                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I’ve a call.<br><br>

                It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It’s the theatrical<br><br>

                Comeback in broad day<br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>

                ‘A miracle!’<br>
                That knocks me out.<br>
                There is a charge<br><br>

                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>

                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br><br>

                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>
                So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
                So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>

                I am your opus,<br>
                I am your valuable,<br>
                The pure gold baby<br><br>

                That melts to a shriek.<br>
                I turn and burn.<br>
                Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>

                Ash, ash—<br>
                You poke and stir.<br>
                Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>

                A cake of soap,<br>
                A wedding ring,<br>
                A gold filling.<br><br>

                Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>
                Beware<br>
                Beware.<br><br>

                Out of the ash<br>
                I rise with my red hair<br>
                And I eat men like air.<br>

                "Lady Lazarus," written in 1962, is one of Sylvia Plath's most renowned poems, exploring themes of resurrection, identity, and defiance. Plath presents herself as Lady Lazarus, drawing parallels to the biblical figure to depict her experiences with death and rebirth. The poem opens with dramatic declarations of repeated resurrections, using vivid and macabre imagery to capture intense emotions and struggles. With fragmented stanzas and abrupt tone shifts, Plath mirrors Lady Lazarus's psyche, employing personal and historical references, including the Holocaust, to underscore her extreme experiences and oppression. As the poem progresses, Lady Lazarus's voice grows increasingly defiant, asserting her indomitable spirit and vowing to rise stronger each time, exacting revenge on those who wronged her. This triumphant conclusion reinforces themes of empowerment and resilience, making "Lady Lazarus" a powerful testament to Plath's strength and artistic vision.

                Hauls me through air—<br>
                Thighs, hair;<br>
                Flakes from my heels.<br><br>

                White<br>
                Godiva, I unpeel—<br>
                Dead hands, dead stringencies.<br><br>

                And now I<br>
                Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.<br>
                The child’s cry<br><br>

                Melts in the wall.<br>
                And I<br>
                Am the arrow,<br><br>

                The dew that flies<br>
                Suicidal, at one with the drive<br>
                Into the red<br><br>

                Eye, the cauldron of morning.<br>

                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br><br>

                I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
                I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
                And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

                They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
                Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
                Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br><br>

                The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
                They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
                Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
                So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

                My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
                Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
                They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br><br>

                Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
                My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
                My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
                Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

                I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
                stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
                They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br><br>

                Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
                I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
                Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
                I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

                I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
                To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
                How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
                The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
                And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
                It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br><br>

                Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

                The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
                Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
                Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br><br>

                Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
                They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
                Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
                A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

                Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
                The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
                Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
                And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
                Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
                And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br><br>

                The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

                Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
                Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
                Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
                Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
                Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
                They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
                Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

                The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
                And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
                Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
                The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
                And comes from a country far away as health.<br>

               Sylvia Plath's poem "Tulips," written in 1961, delves into themes of identity, isolation, and inner conflict through the lens of a hospital experience. Set in a sterile environment, the poem contrasts the speaker's initial comfort with the intrusion of a vibrant bouquet of tulips. The flowers' vivid red color disrupts the speaker's desired detachment, symbolizing a clash between her internal world and the external reality she wishes to escape. Through vivid imagery and personification, Plath captures the tension between isolation and emotional intrusion, as the tulips force the speaker to confront her suppressed feelings and the demands of life beyond the hospital. The poem concludes with the speaker grappling with the persistent impact of the flowers, reflecting Plath's ability to convey deep emotional complexity and the universal struggle between detachment and connection.

                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>

                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>

                I’m no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind’s hand.<br><br>

                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>

                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square<br><br>

                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.<br>
