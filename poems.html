                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>
                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>
                I'm no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind's hand.<br><br>
                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>
                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square<br><br>
                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Morning Song" is a poignant exploration of the speaker’s feelings about motherhood. Sylvia Plath uses striking imagery to depict the transformative experience of bringing a new life into the world. The poem captures both the awe and the raw reality of this experience, with vivid contrasts between the warmth of the maternal bond and the unsettling adjustments that come with it. The tone evolves from the initial shock and wonder to a more introspective and contemplative stance, highlighting the complex emotions associated with becoming a mother.

                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>
                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br>
                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>
                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>
                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>
                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br>
                And I a smiling woman.<br><br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>
                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>
                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br>
                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br><br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentleman, ladies<br>
                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br><br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br>
                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br><br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>
                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br><br>
                I rocked shut<br>
                As a seashell.<br><br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the wormy fruit.<br><br>
                The third time I was angry.<br>
                The cakes of soap<br>
                The tea leaves<br>
                And the bloody hands<br>
                Were worth it.<br><br>
                The gods are with me.<br>
                The gods are alive.<br>
                They have given me what I want,<br>
                And I am the only one<br>
                Who can feel.<br><br>
                Oh my enemy, the flesh is a skin.<br>
                It is all part of me<br>
                To carry on.<br><br>
                This is the time.<br>
                I come into my own<br>
                The flesh an impossible thing.<br><br>
                Gentlemen, ladies,<br>
                Ladies and gentlemen,<br>
                A toast to our fallen flesh,<br>
                As this New Year<br>
                Turns into a slice of mirror.<br><br>
                Thus, I am the happy woman,<br>
                The other faces are blind.<br>
                And my mouth, my ears,<br>
                My hair, my bones,<br>
                My living skin,<br>
                These things I will not surrender,<br>
                But guard in silence.<br><br>
                So be it, so be it.<br>
                I will not give up.<br><br>
                The price is not to be made.<br>
                The gods are full of life,<br>
                And, oh, to remain true<br>
                And fierce.<br><br>
                To walk alive in the bones,<br>
                With a poem in every bone,<br>
                Is worth it.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Lady Lazarus" is a powerful and defiant poem that explores themes of resurrection and identity. Plath employs a dramatic monologue to depict the speaker's repeated confrontations with death and her determination to reclaim her vitality and autonomy. The poem combines stark, visceral imagery with a tone of both anger and triumph, reflecting the speaker’s struggle to assert her strength and individuality in the face of suffering and societal expectations.

                "Tulips" is a vivid and haunting portrayal of the speaker’s experience with illness and recovery. Sylvia Plath uses the imagery of tulips to symbolize the intrusion of life and vitality into a sterile and controlled environment. The poem conveys a sense of overwhelming presence and vitality that disrupts the speaker’s desired state of numbness and isolation, ultimately reflecting on themes of healing and the struggle to reconcile with one’s own existence.

                "Daddy" is one of Sylvia Plath's most intense and controversial poems. It addresses the speaker's complex feelings toward her father, blending personal anguish with historical and cultural references. Plath’s use of stark, powerful imagery and emotional extremes creates a vivid portrayal of the speaker’s struggle with her past and her attempt to exorcize the lingering influence of her father’s memory. The poem reflects themes of oppression, trauma, and the search for resolution.

                The Bell Jar was my world,<br>
                And I was its prisoner.<br>
                I could not escape<br>
                The Bell Jar's hold.<br>
                I was suffocating.<br>
                I was trapped.

                "The Bell Jar" is a poignant exploration of mental illness and personal confinement. The poem uses the metaphor of a bell jar to symbolize the speaker’s feelings of entrapment and suffocation. Plath’s vivid imagery and emotive language reflect the struggles of coping with internal and external pressures, capturing a profound sense of isolation and the search for freedom from one's own psychological struggles.
