                "Ariel" is a vibrant and dynamic poem in which Plath explores themes of transformation and liberation. Through a series of vivid and often surreal images, the speaker undergoes a powerful metamorphosis, moving from a state of confinement to one of freedom and transcendence.

                "Lady Lazarus" deals with themes of resurrection, survival, and defiance.

                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br>
                I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
                I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
                And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

                The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
                They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
                Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
                So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water</span><span class="tooltip">Describes the speaker’s sense of being just another object to the medical staff.</span><br>
                Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
                They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br>
                Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
                My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
                My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
                Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat</span><span class="tooltip">Represents the speaker’s sense of losing control and the burden of personal history.</span><br>
                stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
                They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br>
                Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
                I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
                Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
                I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">I didn’t want any flowers,</span><span class="tooltip">Indicates the speaker’s desire for emptiness and peace, rejecting external distractions.</span><br>
                I only wanted<br>
                To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
                How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
                The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
                And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
                It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br>
                Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">The tulips are too red</span><span class="tooltip">Represents the disruptive and jarring nature of the tulips against the speaker’s desired tranquility.</span><br>
                In the first place, they hurt me.<br>
                Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
                Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br>
                Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
                They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
                Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
                A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">Nobody watched me before,</span><span class="tooltip">The tulips are seen as a symbol of intrusion and unwanted attention.</span><br>
                Now I am watched.<br>
                The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
                Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
                And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
                Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
                And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br>
                The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">Before they came</span><span class="tooltip">Describes the peaceful state before the tulips' intrusion.</span><br>
                The air was calm enough,<br>
                Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
                Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
                Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
                Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
                They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
                Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

                <span class="annotation">The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.</span><span class="tooltip">The walls reflect the speaker's growing awareness of the intrusion of the tulips.</span><br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
                And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
                Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
                The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
                And comes from a country far away as health.

                "Tulips" reflects a confrontation between the speaker’s desire for peace and the disruptive force of external stimuli. The tulips represent a jarring intrusion into the speaker's state of tranquility, leading to a complex interplay between inner and outer worlds.
