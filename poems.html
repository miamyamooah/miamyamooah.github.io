            <div class="poem-title">Morning Song</div>
            <div class="poem-text">
                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>
                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>
                I'm no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind's hand.<br><br>
                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>
                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square<br><br>
                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.

        <div class="poem">
            <div class="poem-title">Lady Lazarus</div>
            <div class="poem-text">
                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>
                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br>
                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>
                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>
                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>
                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br>
                And I a smiling woman.<br><br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>
                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>
                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br>
                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br><br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentleman, ladies<br>
                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br><br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br>
                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br><br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>
                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br><br>
                I rocked shut<br>
                As a seashell.<br><br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>
                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>
                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I've a call.<br><br>
                It's easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It's easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It's the theatrical<br>
                Comeback in broad day<br><br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>
                "A miracle!"<br>
                That knocks me out.<br><br>
                There is a charge<br>
                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>
                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br>
                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br><br>
                So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
                So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>
                I am your opus,<br>
                I am your valuable,<br><br>
                The pure gold baby<br>
                That melts to a shriek.<br><br>
                I turn and burn.<br><br>
                Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>
                Ash, ash——<br>
                You poke and stir.<br><br>
                Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>
                A cake of soap,<br>
                A wedding ring,<br>
                A gold filling.<br><br>
                Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br><br>
                Beware<br><br>
                Beware.<br><br>
                Out of the ash<br>
                I rise with my red hair<br>
                And I eat men like air.

                Stasis in darkness.<br>
                Then the substanceless blue<br>
                Pour of tor and distances.<br><br>
                God’s lioness,<br>
                How one we grow,<br>
                The prelude to a small light<br>
                At the end of the tunnel.<br><br>
                I am the same.<br>
                I am a serious thing,<br>
                We are always there,<br>
                But I am one thing.<br><br>
                Nothing unearths the whole<br>
                Of the self,<br>
                The heaven’s gate.<br><br>
                The well of it<br>
                Once more in a way<br>
                That makes us the way<br><br>
                To the trees,<br>
                To the salt of the earth,<br>
                To the beauty of our lives.<br><br>
                Now we are so much more,<br>
                So real, so intimate.<br>
                The tides and the light,<br>
                Our good friends and family.<br><br>
                The sunrise on the sea,<br>
                The tall trees, the mountains.<br>
                It is the dawn, and all<br>
                Of our changes are done.<br><br>
                We are the wild sea,<br>
                We are the deep sea,<br>
                We are the stars,<br>
                We are the air.<br><br>
                The darkness is rising,<br>
                And I am the sun,<br>
                I am the one,<br>
                I am everything.<br><br>
                We have climbed the rock<br>
                Of our lives.<br>
                We have reached the top,<br>
                And the sky.<br>
                The dark sky of our dreams.

                The tulips are too excitable.<br>
                It is winter now.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like this:<br><br>
                They are like a crowd of people<br>
                On a sidewalk, idle and waiting,<br>
                Their chatter is very loud.<br><br>
                The tulips are too excitable.<br>
                They are so many.<br>
                They are bursting into bloom.<br><br>
                Their petals are too sweet<br>
                They get on my nerves.<br><br>
                Their colors are too strong<br>
                The red in particular.<br>
                It is the loudest.<br><br>
                The tulips are very sweet<br>
                But I cannot stand their noise.<br>
                Their vivid colors annoy me.<br><br>
                The tulips are too excitable.<br>
                The tulips are too loud.<br>
                I want to go back to my dark, quiet place.<br>
                It is winter now,<br>
                And I am all alone.

                First, are you our kind?<br>
                I am a country.<br><br>
                The letter, please,<br>

                Every attribute you may<br>
                Desire in your wife.<br><br>
                Do you want the suitor,<br>
                The raw talent to hear,<br>
                The patient, steady stance?<br><br>
                Will you consider the fortune<br>
                In the fire, the milk,<br>
                The coffee cups<br>
                Arranged in a proper array?<br><br>
                My proud upright.<br>
                Your possibilities<br>
                As each year passes.<br><br>
                Do you want the bread?<br>
                The clear, sharp response<br>
                To your awkwardness,<br>
                The careful, considered move?<br><br>
                Will you take on the man<br>
                Who answered, “I can’t stand it”<br>
                To the proffering word,<br>
                Of family values?<br><br>
                I’ll end with the meat,<br>
                And the rest, the soup.<br>
                We’ll fit the bill.<br>
