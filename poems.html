            <div class="poem-text">
                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>
                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>
                I'm no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind's hand.<br><br>
                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>
                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square<br><br>
                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Morning Song" is a poignant exploration of the speaker’s feelings about motherhood. Sylvia Plath uses striking imagery to depict the transformative experience of bringing a new life into the world. The poem captures both the awe and the raw reality of this experience, with vivid contrasts between the warmth of the maternal bond and the unsettling adjustments that come with it. The tone evolves from the initial shock and wonder to a more introspective and contemplative stance, highlighting the complex emotions associated with becoming a mother.

            <div class="poem-text">
                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>
                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br>
                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>
                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>
                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>
                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br>
                And I a smiling woman.<br><br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>
                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>
                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br>
                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br><br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentleman, ladies<br>
                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br><br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br>
                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br><br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>
                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br><br>
                I rocked shut<br>
                As a seashell.<br><br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>
                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>
                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I've a call.<br><br>
                It's easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It's easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It's the theatrical<br>
                Comeback in broad day<br><br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>
                "A miracle!"<br>
                That knocks me out.<br><br>
                There is a charge<br>
                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>
                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br>
                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br><br>

            <div class="poem-description">

            <div class="poem-text">
                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br><br>
                I could think of nothing but the shadow<br>
                Of my own bones.<br><br>
                I am sitting here and it is my birthday.<br>
                What is the world to me, just the tulips and the bed.<br>
                I sit in the middle of the bed and listen to the silence.<br><br>
                I cannot talk to you, you know what it is like<br>
                To hear a voice so close to your ear.<br><br>
                It is all so ordinary, the way a flower in a vase looks<br>
                And I see that in the window it is snowing, too.<br><br>
                The curtains are open and I see the outside is quiet.<br>
                I feel that the tulips have done their job and the room<br>
                Is cold, and I know it will be over soon.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Tulips" delves into themes of isolation and self-examination through the metaphor of tulips in a stark winter setting. Plath uses the imagery of a cold, quiet room to reflect the speaker’s emotional state and the process of recovery. The tulips, as a symbol of life and color, contrast sharply with the winter’s quiet, representing the speaker’s struggle to reconcile with her own feelings of numbness and detachment. The poem’s serene yet somber tone underscores the speaker’s search for peace and the desire to escape from the demands of life.

                Stasis in darkness.<br>
                Then the substanceless blue<br>
                Pour of tor and distances.<br><br>
                It was the same way I was that night,<br>
                Each space a total stillness,<br>
                Pure white and pure black.<br><br>
                I am a pure sphere, not an arrow<br>
                But a ball that rolls and moves<br>
                Through the dimness.<br><br>
                And then, as if it were all a game,<br>
                I saw a sudden flood of color,<br>
                The fields filled with bright red.<br><br>
                I have a different world now,<br>
                The whole sky a closed eye,<br>
                And a fast-moving world beneath it.<br><br>
                I do not know where I am.<br>
                I am lost in this rushing.<br><br>
                I am a white thing moving fast<br>
                And then the rain.<br><br>
                I have been carried.<br>
                A bright world.<br>
                I am a full ball in this world.

                "Ariel" explores themes of liberation and transcendence. The poem captures the exhilaration of escaping into a new realm of self-discovery and spiritual freedom. Plath's use of vivid imagery and contrasting colors reflects the intensity of this transformative experience. The sense of movement and dynamic energy throughout the poem mirrors the speaker’s journey from darkness to enlightenment, encapsulating the liberating and sometimes chaotic nature of personal awakening.

                Any more, black shoe<br>
                In which I have lived like a foot<br>
                For thirty years, poor and white<br>
                Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.<br><br>
                Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
                You died before I had time——<br>
                Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
                Ghastly statue with a foot in the grave.<br><br>
                I could hardly speak.<br>
                I thought every German was you.<br>
                And the language obscene.<br><br>
                An engine, an engine<br>
                Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
                A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br><br>
                I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
                I think I may well be a Jew.<br><br>
                The snows of yesteryear.<br>
                The black tree.<br><br>
                My enemies are your friends.<br>
                They did not take your life,<br>
                They took me away from you.<br><br>
                The black shoe<br>
                I have had to kill you.<br>
                You were a father to me.<br>
                I have had to kill you.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Daddy" is a confrontational and intense poem where Plath addresses her father and the impact of his death on her psyche. The poem is marked by its raw emotion and stark imagery, reflecting the speaker’s deep-seated pain and complex relationship with her father. Through powerful language and references to historical atrocities, Plath connects personal trauma with broader themes of oppression and suffering. The poem’s emotional intensity and rebellious tone underscore the struggle for self-assertion and liberation from past wounds.

            <div class="poem-text">
                I was supposed to be in Paris<br>
                Sitting in a café<br>
                Drinking dark coffee<br>
                And talking to people<br>
                About poetry and life.<br><br>
                Instead I was in a room<br>
                With a view of the street<br>
                And the gray of a November sky.<br>
                I felt trapped.<br><br>
                My thoughts were muddled<br>
                And my mind was heavy<br>
                With the weight of choices<br>
                And the uncertainty of my future.<br><br>
                I was alone in my thoughts,<br>
                In a place that was both familiar<br>
                And alien, like a bell jar<br>
                Trapping me in my own mind.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "The Bell Jar" delves into the themes of isolation and mental struggle. The poem reflects Plath’s sense of entrapment and disconnection from her surroundings. The imagery of a bell jar captures the feeling of being confined within one’s own mind, struggling with choices and uncertainty. Through this metaphor, Plath conveys the weight of mental anguish and the challenge of finding a sense of clarity and freedom amid overwhelming emotions.
