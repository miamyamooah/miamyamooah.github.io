                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>
                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>
                I'm no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind's hand.<br><br>
                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>
                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square<br><br>
                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Morning Song" is a poignant exploration of the speaker’s feelings about motherhood. Sylvia Plath uses striking imagery to depict the transformative experience of bringing a new life into the world. The poem captures both the awe and the raw reality of this experience, with vivid contrasts between the warmth of the maternal bond and the unsettling adjustments that come with it. The tone evolves from the initial shock and wonder to a more introspective and contemplative stance, highlighting the complex emotions associated with becoming a mother.

                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>
                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br>
                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>
                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>
                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>
                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br>
                And I a smiling woman.<br><br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>
                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>
                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br>
                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br><br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentleman, ladies<br>
                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br><br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br>
                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br><br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>
                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br><br>
                I rocked shut<br>
                As a seashell.<br><br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>
                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>
                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I've a call.<br><br>
                It's easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It's easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It's the theatrical<br>
                Comeback in broad day<br><br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><
                The theatrical<br>
                Comeback in broad day<br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>
                "A miracle!"<br>
                "That’s what you are!"<br><br>
                The lost, the laughter, the glee,<br>
                The pride of this city.<br><br>
                Every time I resurrect, I move closer to the sun.<br>
                I burn myself.<br>
                But it doesn’t matter to me.<br><br>
                So don’t worry.<br>
                It’s all for you.<br>
                I am in my element.<br>
                So you can go on.<br><br>
                You are just a memory of the earth.<br>
                A cloud in my wake.<br>
                And soon, soon,<br>
                I will be nothing but a floating specter.<br><br>
                Take it, take it all away,<br>
                From the murky mists of the sea,<br>
                The earth itself, my body, my life.<br>
                Take it all away,<br>
                To be free, to be pure.

                "Lady Lazarus" is a powerful poem that delves into themes of resurrection, defiance, and identity. Plath uses the metaphor of Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose from the dead, to convey the speaker's experience of repeatedly overcoming adversity. The poem's tone oscillates between darkly triumphant and starkly confronting, reflecting the speaker's struggle and resilience. Plath’s vivid and provocative imagery underscores the intensity of the speaker’s struggle with personal and societal expectations.

                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are like a terrible self-consciousness,<br>
                Their color is not a color but a hysteria.<br><br>
                They’re very beautiful but they make me sick.<br>
                They’re like a kind of reflection of myself,<br>
                A bright, impossible fever.<br><br>
                I wanted to die in your arms<br>
                But now I want the doctors' help<br>
                To keep me away from the hysteria.<br><br>
                Everything I see makes me sick,<br>
                The bright lights and the sounds and the colors<br>
                They’re too strong, too loud,<br>
                They’re like the tulips,<br>
                Bright and impossible, a sickening color.<br><br>
                I am afraid of them,<br>
                I am afraid of myself.<br>
                I am afraid of the light and the sound<br>
                The color that makes me sick.<br><br>
                I am afraid of the tulips,<br>
                Their impossible, bright, loud color,<br>
                Their loud, terrible self-consciousness.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "Tulips" is a vivid exploration of the speaker's experience with illness and the overwhelming presence of the tulips in her hospital room. Plath uses the tulips as a metaphor for the invasive and jarring nature of life outside the hospital, contrasting it with the sterile environment she finds herself in. The poem’s imagery reflects a profound sense of disorientation and discomfort, capturing the speaker's struggle to reconcile her inner state with the external world.

                I was supposed to be having fun.<br>
                What happened to that?<br>
                It was like being caught in a jar<br>
                With the lid stuck tight,<br>
                The pressure closing in on me.<br><br>
                I watched the world from my prison,<br>
                Everything looked strange, muted,<br>
                Like a faded photograph<br>
                Or a memory that I couldn't quite place.<br><br>
                The days drifted by,<br>
                Like clouds in a summer sky,<br>
                And I felt like a puppet<br>
                With strings pulled tight,<br>
                Struggling to break free.<br><br>
                I was supposed to be having fun,<br>
                But all I felt was the weight<br>
                Of the jar pressing down on me,<br>
                Cramping my spirit,<br>
                Squeezing the joy out of my life.

            <div class="poem-description">
                "The Bell Jar" reflects the sense of entrapment and isolation experienced by the speaker. The poem captures the suffocating feeling of being confined and disconnected from life’s vibrancy. Plath’s imagery evokes a deep sense of discomfort and a struggle against the constraints imposed by external and internal forces, conveying the emotional weight of feeling trapped in one’s own existence.
