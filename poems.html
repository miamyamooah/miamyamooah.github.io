                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>

                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br><br>

                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>

                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>

                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>

                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br><br>

                And I a smiling woman.<br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>

                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>

                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br><br>

                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentlemen, ladies<br><br>

                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br><br>

                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>

                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br>
                I rocked shut<br><br>

                As a seashell.<br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>

                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>

                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I’ve a call.<br><br>

                It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It’s the theatrical<br><br>

                Comeback in broad day<br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>

                ‘A miracle!’<br>
                That knocks me out.<br>
                There is a charge<br><br>

                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>

                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br><br>

                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>
                So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
                So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>

                I am your opus,<br>
                I am your valuable,<br>
                The pure gold baby<br><br>

                That melts to a shriek.<br>
                I turn and burn.<br>
                Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>

                Ash, ash—<br>
                You poke and stir.<br>
                Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>

                A cake of soap,<br>
                A wedding ring,<br>
                A gold filling.<br><br>

                Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>
                Beware<br>
                Beware.<br><br>

                Out of the ash<br>
                I rise with my red hair<br>
                And I eat men like air.<br>

                "Lady Lazarus" explores themes of resurrection, defiance, and the struggle for autonomy. The speaker portrays their repeated deaths and comebacks as a form of artistry and rebellion against those who seek to control or diminish them.

                Stasis in darkness.<br>
                Then the substanceless blue<br>
                Pour of tor and distances.<br><br>

                God’s lioness,<br>
                How one we grow,<br>
                Pivot of heels and knees!—The furrow<br><br>

                Splits and passes, sister to<br>
                The brown arc<br>
                Of the neck I cannot catch,<br><br>

                White<br>
                Godiva, I unpeel—<br>
                Dead hands, dead stringencies.<br><br>

                And now I<br>
                Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.<br>
                The child’s cry<br><br>

                Melts in the wall.<br>
                And I<br>
                Am the arrow,<br><br>

                The dew that flies<br>
                Suicidal, at one with the drive<br>
                Into the red<br><br>

                Eye, the cauldron of morning.<br>

                "Ariel" presents a vivid, surreal journey of transformation and liberation. The imagery reflects the speaker's movement from darkness to enlightenment and their union with a higher, almost divine force.

            <div id="tulips" class="poem-text">
                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br><br>

                I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
                I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
                And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

                They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
                Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
                Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br><br>

                The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
                They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
                Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
                So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

                My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
                Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
                They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br><br>

                Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
                My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
                My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
                Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

                I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
                stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
                They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br><br>

                Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
                I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
                Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
                I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

                I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
                To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
                How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
                The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
                And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
                It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br><br>

                Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

                The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
                Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
                Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br><br>

                Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
                They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
                Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
                A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

                Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
                The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
                Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
                And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
                Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
                And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br><br>

                The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

                Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
                Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
                Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
                Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
                Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
                They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
                Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

                The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
                And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
                Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
                The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
                And comes from a country far away as health.<br>

                "Tulips" depicts the speaker's struggle with their identity and surroundings after a medical procedure. The poem contrasts the tranquility they seek with the vibrant, intrusive presence of the tulips, reflecting a conflict between inner peace and external realities.

                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>

                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>

                I’m no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind’s hand.<br><br>

                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>

                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square<br><br>

                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.<br>

                "Morning Song" captures the raw and immediate experience of new motherhood. The poem juxtaposes the miraculous arrival of a child with the mundane aspects of daily life, highlighting both the wonder and the adjustments that come with becoming a parent.
