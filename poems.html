                You do not do, you do not do<br>
                Any more, black shoe<br>
                In which I have lived like a foot<br>
                For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
                Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.<br><br>

                Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
                You died before I had time——<br>
                Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
                Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
                Big as a Frisco seal<br><br>

                And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>
                Where it pours bean green over blue<br>
                In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>
                I used to pray to recover you.<br>
                Ach, du.<br><br>

                In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
                Scraped flat by the roller<br>
                Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
                But the name of the town is common.<br>
                My Polack friend<br><br>

                Says there are a dozen or two.<br>
                So I never could tell where you<br>
                Put your foot, your root,<br>
                I never could talk to you.<br>
                The tongue stuck in my jaw.<br><br>

                It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>
                Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
                I could hardly speak.<br>
                I thought every German was you.<br>
                And the language obscene<br><br>

                An engine, an engine<br>
                Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
                A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>
                I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
                I think I may well be a Jew.<br><br>

                The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>
                Are not very pure or true.<br>
                With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>
                And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
                I may be a bit of a Jew.<br><br>

                I have always been scared of you,<br>
                With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
                And your neat mustache<br>
                And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
                Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——<br><br>

                Not God but a swastika<br>
                So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
                Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
                The boot in the face, the brute<br>
                Brute heart of a brute like you.<br><br>

                You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
                In the picture I have of you,<br>
                A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
                But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
                Any less the black man who<br><br>

                Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
                I was ten when they buried you.<br>
                At twenty I tried to die<br>
                And get back, back, back to you.<br>
                I thought even the bones would do.<br><br>

                But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
                And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
                And then I knew what to do.<br>
                I made a model of you,<br>
                A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br><br>

                And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
                And I said I do, I do.<br>
                So daddy, I’m finally through.<br>
                The black telephone’s off at the root,<br>
                The voices just can’t worm through.<br><br>

                If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——<br>
                The vampire who said he was you<br>
                And drank my blood for a year,<br>
                Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
                Daddy, you can lie back now.<br><br>

                There’s a stake in your fat black heart<br>
                And the villagers never liked you.<br>
                They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
                They always knew it was you.<br>
                Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.<br>

            <div class="poem-description">
                Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" is a powerful and intense poem that delves into themes of identity, trauma, and liberation. Written in 1962, the poem reflects Plath's complex relationship with her deceased father, Otto Plath, and explores her feelings of anger, grief, and betrayal. The poem's tone is both accusatory and confessional, as Plath uses vivid and sometimes violent imagery to portray her father's influence on her life and psyche.
"Daddy" is structured as a dramatic monologue, where the speaker addresses her father directly, expressing her long-held resentments and the emotional scars he left behind. Plath employs various metaphors and allusions throughout the poem, comparing her father to a Nazi, herself to a victim of the Holocaust, and referencing figures like the Devil. These comparisons underscore the intensity of her emotions and the profound impact her father had on her.
The poem is also notable for its use of rhythm and sound. Plath's repetition of certain phrases and the nursery rhyme-like cadence create a haunting and almost hypnotic effect, drawing readers into the speaker's turbulent inner world. As the poem progresses, the speaker moves towards a sense of liberation, ultimately declaring her freedom from her father's shadow.
"Daddy" is considered one of Plath's most famous and controversial works, often analyzed for its autobiographical elements and its raw depiction of personal anguish. It remains a testament to Plath's skill as a poet and her ability to convey deep emotional truths through her writing.

                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>

                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br><br>

                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>

                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>

                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>

                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br><br>

                And I a smiling woman.<br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>

                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>

                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br><br>

                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentlemen, ladies<br><br>

                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br><br>

                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>

                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br>
                I rocked shut<br><br>

                As a seashell.<br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>

                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>

                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I’ve a call.<br><br>

                It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It’s the theatrical<br><br>

                Comeback in broad day<br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>

                ‘A miracle!’<br>
                That knocks me out.<br>
                There is a charge<br><br>

                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>

                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br><br>

                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>
                So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
                So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>

                I am your opus,<br>
                I am your valuable,<br>
                The pure gold baby<br><br>

                That melts to a shriek.<br>
                I turn and burn.<br>
                Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>

                Ash, ash—<br>
                You poke and stir.<br>
                Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>

                A cake of soap,<br>
                A wedding ring,<br>
                A gold filling.<br><br>

                Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>
                Beware<br>
                Beware.<br><br>

                Out of the ash<br>
                I rise with my red hair<br>
                And I eat men like air.<br>

                "Lady Lazarus" is one of Sylvia Plath's most renowned and striking poems, written in 1962. The poem is a powerful exploration of themes such as resurrection, identity, and defiance. Plath presents herself as Lady Lazarus, drawing a parallel to the biblical figure Lazarus, who was raised from the dead, to depict her own experiences with death and rebirth.
The poem opens with a dramatic declaration of Lady Lazarus's repeated resurrections, likening her ability to return from the brink of death to a theatrical performance. Plath's use of vivid and often macabre imagery captures the intensity of her emotions and the physical and psychological toll of her struggles. The poem is charged with a sense of defiance and resilience, as Lady Lazarus confronts the forces that seek to control and destroy her.
Plath's choice of language and structure in "Lady Lazarus" is both provocative and poignant. The poem's fragmented stanzas and abrupt shifts in tone mirror the fragmented nature of Lady Lazarus's psyche. Plath employs a mix of personal and historical references, including the Holocaust, to underscore the extremity of her experiences and the pervasive sense of oppression she feels.
As the poem progresses, Lady Lazarus's voice becomes increasingly defiant, culminating in a powerful assertion of her indomitable spirit. She declares that she will rise again and again, stronger each time, and exact revenge on those who have wronged her. This triumphant conclusion reinforces the themes of empowerment and resilience, making "Lady Lazarus" a compelling testament to Plath's enduring strength and artistic vision.
"Lady Lazarus" is celebrated for its raw intensity and unflinching exploration of the human condition. It stands as a testament to Sylvia Plath's brilliance as a poet and her ability to transform personal suffering into profound and universal art.

                Something else<br><br>

                Hauls me through air—<br>
                Thighs, hair;<br>
                Flakes from my heels.<br><br>

                White<br>
                Godiva, I unpeel—<br>
                Dead hands, dead stringencies.<br><br>

                And now I<br>
                Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.<br>
                The child’s cry<br><br>

                Melts in the wall.<br>
                And I<br>
                Am the arrow,<br><br>

                The dew that flies<br>
                Suicidal, at one with the drive<br>
                Into the red<br><br>

                Eye, the cauldron of morning.<br>

                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br><br>

                I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
                I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
                And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

                They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
                Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
                Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br><br>

                The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
                They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
                Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
                So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

                My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
                Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
                They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br><br>

                Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
                My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
                My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
                Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

                I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
                stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
                They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br><br>

                Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
                I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
                Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
                I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

                I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
                To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
                How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
                The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
                And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
                It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br><br>

                Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

                The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
                Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
                Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br><br>

                Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
                They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
                Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
                A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

                Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
                The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
                Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
                And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
                Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
                And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br><br>

                The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

                Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
                Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
                Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
                Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
                Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
                They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
                Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

                The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
                And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
                Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
                The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
                And comes from a country far away as health.<br>

                Sylvia Plath's poem "Tulips," written in 1961, is a poignant and introspective work that explores themes of identity, isolation, and the struggle for inner peace. The poem is set in a hospital room, where the speaker, recovering from surgery, is confronted by a vibrant bouquet of tulips. The flowers become a focal point for the speaker's reflections on her emotional state and the intrusive nature of the external world.
"Tulips" opens with a depiction of the hospital room's sterile, white environment, which represents a space of detachment and numbness. The speaker initially finds comfort in this blank, quiet setting, as it allows her to disconnect from the demands and chaos of life. However, the arrival of the tulips disrupts this fragile tranquility. Their bright red color and vivacious presence serve as a stark contrast to the white room and the speaker's desire for stillness.
Plath's use of vivid imagery and personification in "Tulips" highlights the tension between the speaker's internal world and the external forces that intrude upon it. The tulips are described as aggressive and overwhelming, with their red color symbolizing vitality and emotional intensity. They force the speaker to confront her suppressed emotions and the reality of her existence.
Throughout the poem, the speaker grapples with feelings of vulnerability and the loss of personal identity. The tulips, with their vibrant energy, remind her of the life she has momentarily escaped and the responsibilities that await her. Plath's language captures the speaker's sense of being overwhelmed and invaded by these reminders of the outside world.
"Tulips" concludes with the speaker acknowledging the persistent presence of the flowers and the emotional impact they have on her. The poem's exploration of the tension between isolation and connection, detachment and engagement, resonates deeply with readers. It is a testament to Plath's skill in conveying complex emotional landscapes and her ability to transform personal experiences into universal reflections on the human condition.

                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>

                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>

                I’m no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind’s hand.<br><br>

                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>

                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square<br><br>

                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.<br>

                Sylvia Plath's poem "Morning Song," written in 1961, is a tender and contemplative exploration of motherhood and the complex emotions that accompany the birth of a child. The poem captures the speaker's evolving relationship with her newborn, delving into themes of love, identity, and the transformative power of new life.
"Morning Song" opens with a vivid and unconventional image of a newborn's cry, likening it to a "fat gold watch." This metaphor sets the tone for the poem, emphasizing the preciousness and the mechanical regularity of the baby's existence. The poem’s language reflects a sense of awe and detachment, as the speaker adjusts to the reality of motherhood and the presence of the new life she has brought into the world.
As the poem progresses, the speaker's initial feelings of disconnection give way to a growing sense of intimacy and connection with her child. Plath's use of imagery and sound captures the delicate and ephemeral moments shared between mother and baby, such as the baby's breath and the tender acts of care. The poem’s soft, lyrical quality reflects the tenderness of these interactions.
Plath's portrayal of the speaker's emotional journey is both honest and nuanced. The speaker grapples with her identity as a mother and the profound responsibility that comes with it. The imagery of the baby's breath, compared to a "moth," underscores the fragility and the newness of life, while the descriptions of nighttime awakenings and the sound of the baby's cry highlight the all-consuming nature of caring for a newborn.
The poem concludes with a sense of acceptance and wonder, as the speaker watches her child in the morning light. The "handful of notes" that the baby produces symbolizes the start of a new song, a new beginning. Plath captures the beauty and complexity of the mother-child relationship, acknowledging both the challenges and the profound joy that it brings.
"Morning Song" is celebrated for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth. It stands as a testament to Sylvia Plath's ability to convey the intricate and multifaceted experiences of motherhood, transforming personal moments into universal reflections on love, identity, and the passage of time.
