                You do not do, you do not do<br>
                Any more, black shoe<br>
                In which I have lived like a foot<br>
                For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
                Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.<br><br>

                Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
                You died before I had time——<br>
                Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
                Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
                Big as a Frisco seal<br><br>

                And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>
                Where it pours bean green over blue<br>
                In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>
                I used to pray to recover you.<br>
                Ach, du.<br><br>

                In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
                Scraped flat by the roller<br>
                Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
                But the name of the town is common.<br>
                My Polack friend<br><br>

                Says there are a dozen or two.<br>
                So I never could tell where you<br>
                Put your foot, your root,<br>
                I never could talk to you.<br>
                The tongue stuck in my jaw.<br><br>

                It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>
                Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
                I could hardly speak.<br>
                I thought every German was you.<br>
                And the language obscene<br><br>

                An engine, an engine<br>
                Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
                A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>
                I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
                I think I may well be a Jew.<br><br>

                The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>
                Are not very pure or true.<br>
                With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>
                And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
                I may be a bit of a Jew.<br><br>

                I have always been scared of you,<br>
                With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
                And your neat mustache<br>
                And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
                Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——<br><br>

                Not God but a swastika<br>
                So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
                Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
                The boot in the face, the brute<br>
                Brute heart of a brute like you.<br><br>

                You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
                In the picture I have of you,<br>
                A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
                But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
                Any less the black man who<br><br>

                Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
                I was ten when they buried you.<br>
                At twenty I tried to die<br>
                And get back, back, back to you.<br>
                I thought even the bones would do.<br><br>

                But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
                And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
                And then I knew what to do.<br>
                I made a model of you,<br>
                A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br><br>

                And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
                And I said I do, I do.<br>
                So daddy, I’m finally through.<br>
                The black telephone’s off at the root,<br>
                The voices just can’t worm through.<br><br>

                If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——<br>
                The vampire who said he was you<br>
                And drank my blood for a year,<br>
                Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
                Daddy, you can lie back now.<br><br>

                There’s a stake in your fat black heart<br>
                And the villagers never liked you.<br>
                They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
                They always knew it was you.<br>
                Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.<br>

                I have done it again.<br>
                One year in every ten<br>
                I manage it——<br><br>

                A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
                Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
                My right foot<br><br>

                A paperweight,<br>
                My face a featureless, fine<br>
                Jew linen.<br><br>

                Peel off the napkin<br>
                O my enemy.<br>
                Do I terrify?——<br><br>

                The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
                The sour breath<br>
                Will vanish in a day.<br><br>

                Soon, soon the flesh<br>
                The grave cave ate will be<br>
                At home on me<br><br>

                And I a smiling woman.<br>
                I am only thirty.<br>
                And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>

                This is Number Three.<br>
                What a trash<br>
                To annihilate each decade.<br><br>

                What a million filaments.<br>
                The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
                Shoves in to see<br><br>

                Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br>
                The big strip tease.<br>
                Gentlemen, ladies<br><br>

                These are my hands<br>
                My knees.<br>
                I may be skin and bone,<br><br>

                Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>
                The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
                It was an accident.<br><br>

                The second time I meant<br>
                To last it out and not come back at all.<br>
                I rocked shut<br><br>

                As a seashell.<br>
                They had to call and call<br>
                And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>

                Dying<br>
                Is an art, like everything else.<br>
                I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>

                I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
                I do it so it feels real.<br>
                I guess you could say I’ve a call.<br><br>

                It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
                It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
                It’s the theatrical<br><br>

                Comeback in broad day<br>
                To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
                Amused shout:<br><br>

                ‘A miracle!’<br>
                That knocks me out.<br>
                There is a charge<br><br>

                For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
                For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                It really goes.<br><br>

                And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
                For a word or a touch<br>
                Or a bit of blood<br><br>

                Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>
                So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
                So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>

                I am your opus,<br>
                I am your valuable,<br>
                The pure gold baby<br><br>

                That melts to a shriek.<br>
                I turn and burn.<br>
                Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>

                Ash, ash—<br>
                You poke and stir.<br>
                Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>

                A cake of soap,<br>
                A wedding ring,<br>
                A gold filling.<br><br>

                Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>
                Beware<br>
                Beware.<br><br>

                Out of the ash<br>
                I rise with my red hair<br>
                And I eat men like air.<br>

                "Lady Lazarus" explores themes of resurrection, defiance, and the struggle for autonomy. The speaker portrays their repeated deaths and comebacks as a form of artistry and rebellion against those who seek to control or diminish them.

                The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
                Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
                I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
                As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br>
                I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
                I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
                And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

                They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
                Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
                Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br>
                The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
                They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
                Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
                So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

                My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
                Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
                They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br>
                Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
                My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
                My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
                Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

                I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
                stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
                They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br>
                Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
                I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
                Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
                I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

                I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
                To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
                How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
                The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
                And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
                It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br>
                Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

                The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
                Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
                Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br>
                Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
                They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
                Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
                A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

                Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
                The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
                Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
                And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
                Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
                And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br>
                The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

                Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
                Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
                Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
                Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
                Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
                They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
                Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

                The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
                The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
                They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
                And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
                Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
                The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
                And comes from a country far away as health.<br>

                "Tulips" reflects on themes of confinement, identity, and the struggle between the desire for peace and the intrusion of external forces. The speaker's experience in a hospital and their interaction with the vibrant tulips symbolize a clash between tranquility and the overwhelming presence of the outside world.

                Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
                The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
                Took its place among the elements.<br><br>

                Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
                In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
                Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>

                I’m no more your mother<br>
                Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
                Effacement at the wind’s hand.<br><br>

                All night your moth-breath<br>
                Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
                A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>

                One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
                In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
                Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square<br><br>

                Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
                Your handful of notes;<br>
                The clear vowels rise like balloons.<br>

                "Morning Song" captures the raw and immediate experience of new motherhood. The poem juxtaposes the miraculous arrival of a child with the mundane aspects of daily life, highlighting both the wonder and the adjustments that come with becoming a parent.
