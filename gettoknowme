  <h1> My name is Mariah. </h1>
    <p> I am in my second semester here at Quinnipiac University, working on my Masters in Instructional Design. I live in New York City and work as a barista at my local coffee shop. </p>

  <h2> Something I have learned: </h2>
    <p> I am fairly new to Instructional Design, so I am gaining a lot of new skills with the information provided here in this program. I have never worked with any coding, so I am learning how to navigate this new information. It seems complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it seems simple. </p>
